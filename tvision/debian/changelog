 -- Ivan Baldo <ibaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Wed, 27 Aug 2008 00:34:14 -0300

rhtvision (2.1.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added XBS-Bugs: mailto:ibaldo@adinet.com.uy fields to the control file

    Tracking System.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.7.2.2, no changes.

rhtvision (2.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer delete these files because they no longer exist or are deleted
    by the upstream now: linuxso/gkeyli.cc, linuxso/instlib,
    linuxso/rhide.env, linux/rhide.env, linuxso/Makefile, linuxso/compat.mak,
    intl/es_iso.mo, intl/es_iso.po, intl/es.mo, intl/ru.mo, intl/pl.mo.

    #define _LIBINTL_H 1 in include/compatlayer.h.

 -- Ivan Baldo <ibaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Wed, 25 Jan 2006 20:21:46 -0200

rhtvision (2.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, still unstable so we cannot guarantee that nothing
    bad happens to your dog if you use this stuff!
  * Updated Build-Depends: added "file" (but I am not sure it is used or
    needed, dpkg-depcheck reported it though), instead
    of xlibs-dev | xlib6g-dev now it has libxmu-dev | xlibs-dev | xlib6g-dev
    and libx11-dev | xlibs-dev | xlib6g-dev, this should give backwards
    compatibility for various old Debian versions.
  * Changed Depends of rhtvision*-dev package: removed libc6-dev and
    libstdc++-dev since they are build-essential and also if someone is going
    to compile something like a hello world in C++ they should have them,
    instead of xlibs-dev | xlib6g-dev now it has libxmu-dev | xlibs-dev |
    xlib6g-dev and libx11-dev | xlibs-dev | xlib6g-dev.
  * Remove on clean the generated intl/pl.mo file (doh! come on Salvador!
    provide a complete clean target! distribution packagers shouldn't be doing
    this stuff).
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.6.2.0, we should rename this package
    librhtv but I don't like it too much.

rhtvision (2.0.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * With a new version of lintian it complained that we should not
    build-depend on make and gzip because the first is a build-essential
    package and the second is an essential package. 

 -- Ivan Baldo <ibaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Tue,  5 Oct 2004 20:24:34 -0200

rhtvision (2.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version! CVS release 2.573 2004/09/22 21:26:40.
  * Its been so long... I don't remember almost anything about Debian
    packaging; I was very quiet all this time, without doing testing releases
    and without testing developer versions. I am extremely lazy since then,
    not only for this but for many other things of life in general, my home
    computer isn't very well maintained neither and I am not very aware about
    Debian as I was before. Anyway, lets try to be a bit useful and at the
    same time thankful of this superb software.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.6.1.0 (and I hope it complies!).

 -- Ivan Baldo <ibaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Sun, 26 Sep 2004 21:12:11 -0200

  * Upstream released a new fixed version! CVS release 2.493 2003/07/30
    19:43:18 with sticky tag r2_0_2-1.
  * Upstream fixed the show-stoper bug regarding the not versioned tvision.mo
    files.

 -- Ivan Baldo <ibaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Sun, 10 Aug 2003 15:10:43 -0300

rhtvision (2.0.2-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version! CVS release 2.487 2003/07/16 14:00:57.
  * Sorry for the lateness, but I am very busy now, too much work, though I
    don't regret! I finally got a good job!!!
  * Salvador did changes to the Debian packaging:
    - Don't build-depend on recode (not required anymore).
    - Added README file, it is similar to maintainer.notes.
    - Added --no-libs-here --real-prefix=/usr to ./configure.
    - If tar fails when doing the backup of files modified doing the build it
    doesn't stop the package generation, because some tar failings are due to
    files not existing or silly errors.
    - Added usr/bin directory to the -dev package, since it will contain the
    rhtv-config program.
  * Added doc/I18n.txt and doc/Streams.txt to the -dev package.
  * Now sets the flags for the compiler in the environment instead of in the
    make invocation.
  * Specify explicitly -g and -Wall compiling options.
  * Supports DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS as per Policy 3.5.7.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.5.8.0 (and I hope it complies!).
  * Removed a lot of obsolete files in files_to_backup.
  * Remove on clean makes/rhide.env, redhat/librhtv-*.spec and
    makes/libtvfintl.a.
  * The debian/copyright file references the GPL license text in the
    /usr/share/common-licenses/ directory, thanks Lintian!!!
  * Remove final dots in the single line description of the packages, thanks
    Lintian!!!
  * There is a pending bug with this library which forces this to not be an
    official final release: the .mo files are called tvision.mo, thus if the
    user wants to install 2 different versions of the library, one will
    overwrite the other and dpkg will complain, and if we force dpkg to
    continue anyway, the translations will be messed up for one version of
    the library. This is not Debian specific though.

 -- Ivan Baldo <ibaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Sun, 27 Jul 2003 19:00:47 -0300

rhtvision (2.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This Debian release is dedicated to the crew of the space shuttle
    Columbia.
  * Build-Depends on gettext and recode to ensure correct i18n support.

rhtvision (2.0.1-0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, not yet stable. CVS dated 13 Dec 2002.
  * Added examples/bhelp/thelp.mak to files_to_backup.

 -- Ivan Baldo <ibaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Sat, 14 Dec 2002 19:22:09 -0300

rhtvision (2.0.1-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, near to be stable. CVS dated 3 Dec 2002.
  * Specify absolute path in the ./configure --prefix=foo, this fixes
    problems with wrong installation of translation files (.mo).
  * Remove intl/es_iso.mo, intl/es_iso.po, intl/es.mo and intl/ru.mo.
  * Backup linux/libtvfintl.a.
  * Add locale files to the runtime library package.
  * I am looking for a job (a paid one) for a long time but things are really
    dificult here in Uruguay, if you have a job for me, don't hesitate to
    contact!

    doc/Eterm.txt, doc/Linux.txt, doc/TVReference.html, doc/XTerm.txt and
    THANKS.

rhtvision (2.0.0-0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * New beta from CVS dated 11 Sep 2002.
  * Now is on feature freeze and testing period!!!
  * Installs doc/X11.txt document (noticed by Salvador).
  * Added information about APT repository in README.Debian.
  * README.Debian wasn't being installed on the shared library package, only
    in the -dev (static library) package, I don't know why dh_installdocs
    just installs it for the 1st. package mentioned in debian/control only,
    instead of installing it for all packages.
  * debian/maintainer.notes: it was very outdated, now contains accurate and
    more useful information.

 -- Ivan Baldo <ibaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Wed, 11 Sep 2002 15:00:44 -0300

rhtvision (2.0.0-0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * New alpha from CVS dated 5 Sep 2002.
  * Removed the add-log-mailing-address Emacs directive from the changelog
    since the policy now prohibits it (detected by lintian).
  * Implemented safe calls to ldconfig (detected by lintian), added file
    debian/rhtvision.postrm for that (and remembered to update debian/rules
    and lista).
  
 -- Ivan Baldo <ibaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Thu,  5 Sep 2002 17:43:19 -0300

rhtvision (2.0.0-0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * New alpha from CVS dated 25 jul 2002 (hey! that's my birthday!!!).
  * Removed debian/manpage.1.ex since it is likely that this package will
    never need it.
  * I changed my email from lubaldo to ibaldo, so updated that everywhere.
  * Backup the following files: examples/clipboard/test.mak,
    examples/fonts/genraw.mak, examples/helpdemo/helpdemo.mak,
    win32/Makefile.
  * Added more comments to the debian/rules file, it seems that Salvador was
    confused one time :).
  * Removed some CVS files and directories that where appearing on the
    rhtvision2.0.0 package.
  * Changed dependencies a little on debian/control, to help Potato users and
    making the package more robust when building (suggested by Salvador), not
    depend on specific versions of libraries or use | operators.
    
 -- Ivan Baldo <ibaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Mon, 29 Jul 2002 16:49:04 -0300

rhtvision (1.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Ivan hates computers after having good vacations" release.
    Well, I was on Punta del Este, good beachs, good womans, some fun
    at night, and no computers :). My hate for computers is temporary
    and it happens everytime I have good vacations, so don't worry.
  * New stable version, it fixes some memory leaks, improves
    compilation, some other tiny things, etc.
  * No need to remove the configure.cache file from debian/rules, it
    is done by the upstream makefile now.
  * Added linuxso/makemak.pl and win32/rhide.env to the files_to_backup.
  * Remove linuxso/rhide.env symlink on clean.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Tue,  8 Jan 2002 12:08:52 -0300

rhtvision (1.1.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Finally! RHTVision 1.1.3 is officially stable now!
  * There was an empty and useless usr/share/man/man3 directory on the
    package, now is gone.
  * Added compat/compat.mak to files_to_backup.
  * Remove generated linuxso/instlib on clean.
  * Don't remove linuxso/makemak.pl on clean.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Sun, 11 Nov 2001 15:41:50 -0300

rhtvision (1.1.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now compiles with -D_REENTRANT as Debian Policy mandates.
  * Now runs ./configure before make clean (reported by Salvador).
  * Don't eliminate the ldconfig invocation of the upstream Makefile,
    it seems that upstream has corrected its Makefile now (done after
    Salvador reported that it didn't work on all systems, because I was
    overwriting the Makefile while I was reading it, specially on
    multiprocesor systems).
  * Added include/tv/configtv.h to files_to_backup.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Wed, 17 Oct 2001 16:29:17 -0300

rhtvision (1.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Upstream added a "buildpackage" script, I don't see the point of
    it but if it is of some use to Salvador or others, I will keep it.
  * Modified the new debian/buildpackage script to check before trying
    to do anything that it is being run from the right directory.
  * Simplified the backup system by using a TAR archive instead of
    copying and moving files around. Good idea from Salvador. At the
    same time now timestamps are preserved so CVS checkins are faster.
  * Uncommented out the binary-indep target, just in case.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Sun, 14 Oct 2001 01:15:59 -0300

rhtvision (1.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Upstream provides clean target!!! At last!!! Let's use it.
  * No more *.bkpdeb files on the distribution.
  * Upstream clean is not complete yet, so we still clean some files on
    our own.
  * Added to backup system: linuxso/compat.mak and win32/Makefile.
  * We delete the line containing 'ldconfig' on the Makefile, this
    causes a failure when compiling with fakeroot.
  * Added clean-debian to the .PHONY list.
  * Added Replaces: rhtvision-dev for more easy upgrades.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Sun,  7 Oct 2001 18:18:56 -0300

rhtvision (1.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release!!!
  * Salvador (upstream) made minor changes to some descriptions on the
    control file and README.Debian for better description of the
    distribution issues.
  * Salvador also made small modifications to debian/rules to adapt to
    his changes of my previous patch for the -fPIC compilation of the
    compat library.
  * Now before building we backup upstream files that are regenerated
    and on clean we restore that files from the backups, so you can
    build, rebuild, clean, reclean and original files are maintained.
    As a plus this allows me to do a diff file for the upstream without
    hassles.
  * Now removes all .cvsignore files from the packages.
  * Added xlibs-dev to Build-Depends so that the library compiles with
    enhanced support for Eterm 0.8.10+.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Fri, 28 Sep 2001 21:26:36 -0300

rhtvision (1.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version! Rejoice.
  * Modified compat/ticks.c to include stdlib.h otherwise NULL is
    undefined.
  * Updated cleaning of generated files.
  * Support for compiling the compatibility library with PIC code (thanks
    Lintian for reporting this!).

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Fri, 10 Aug 2001 16:07:50 -0300

rhtvision (1.0.9-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Long time ago, this package (and other depending package) had to be
    removed from the Debian distribution because of yet unresolved legal
    problems with Inprise, fortunately the package had not been distributed
    with any official Debian release.
  * Slight changes to upstream source to make it compile on current
    unstable distribution.
  * Debian control file updated for new dependencies.
  * Standards version 3.5.2.0.
  * Do not use now deprecated dh_testversion, use a versioned build-dependency
    on DebHelper instead.
  * Made it clear that this is not an official package and that it is not
    redistributable (control file, copyright, README.Debian, etc.).

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Sun, 10 Jun 2001 19:05:26 -0300

rhtvision (1.0.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Standards version 3.1.0.
  * Added Build-Depends.
  * Architecture set to "any" instead of "i386 alpha" as requested by
    Roman Hodek. This library isn't tested on other architectures other
    than i386 or alpha, so, testing is needed and reports of success or
    failures will be apreciated.
    See bug 50319.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Wed,  1 Dec 1999 00:38:51 -0300

rhtvision (1.0.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't install manpage (symlink to undocumented(7) manpage).
  * Remove .cvsignore file in usr/share/doc/rhtvision-dev/examples
    directory.
  * Don't use install-stamp (in rules file) anymore, to avoid possible
    duplicate strings in maintainer script fragment files (see
    debhelper changelog of version 2.0.56).

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Mon,  1 Nov 1999 13:01:46 -0300

rhtvision (1.0.8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upstream sent newer compilation scripts (bugfixes, enhancements).
  * Modified and bugfixed debian/maintainer.notes.
  * Now shared library package Conflicts: rhtvision1. This is to force
    the people who installed the previously broken library to uninstall
    that library and its programs and upgrade everything. Sorry.
  * Now rm -f linuxso/librhtv.so on clean.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Tue, 21 Sep 1999 12:50:24 -0300

rhtvision (1.0.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    - Various bugfixes.
    - Various improvements.
    - Building system changed!
    - Soname changes with every version (since every version is binary
      incompatible).
  * Now the -dev package depends on libstdc++-dev.
  * Architecture is now i386 and alpha.
  * Changed the name of the package from rhtvision to rhtvision1.0.8.
    This name will change for every version of the library, since
    every version is binary incompatible with the others.
  * Improved and updated debian/maintainer.notes, please read it.
  * Not include debugging version of the static library anymore.
    If someone needs this, then tell me and I will include it again.
  * Now requires debhelper 2.0.40 or greater (FHS related).
  * Added DH_COMPAT=1 to debian/rules.
  * Don't use .dirs files anymore.
  * Don't use .files files anymore.
  * Don't use .docs files anymore.
  * Various changes to debian/rules file.

    - Other minor enhancements.
  * Added source dependencies to debian/maintainer.notes.
  * Modified #!/bin/sh to #!/bin/sh -e for better error detection.
  * Policy 3.0.0 compliant (FHS move).

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Mon, 26 Jul 1999 17:19:36 -0300

rhtvision (1.0.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * I don't use dh_installexamples anymore, since it doesn't work for
    me, instead I install the examples manually. So, there isn't
    anymore the /usr/doc/rhtvision1-dev/examples/examples directory,
    instead, there's only one examples directory.

rhtvision (1.0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    - Bugfixes.
    - Debian diffs incorporated on upstream source.
    - Renamed the name of the library from libtv to librhtv.
    - Some more classes added.
  * Standards version now is 2.5.0.0 (no changes).
  * Instead of doing the symlinks manually, now I use dh_link.
  * Now requires debhelpers >= 1.2.9.
  * Mention in debian/maintainer.notes that debian/rules should be mode
    755.

rhtvision (1.0.3-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed postrm for rhtvision1-dev and rhtvision1, since it is not
    necessary.
  * Removed postinst for rhtvision1-dev since it is not necessary.
  * Packages checked with Lintian, there are some warnings yet...
  * Added maintainer.notes, gives usefull information for the
    maintainer (hey, thats me!).
  * I forgot about doing a symlink in the rhtvision1-dev package from
    rhtvision1.so to rhtvision1.so.1.0.3 (Lintian not complained about
    this!).

rhtvision (1.0.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patches from upstream maintainer. Avoiding deleting some
    files that should not be deleted, added a clean-debian rule to
    clean Debian specific files, only headers files are copied from the
    include directory, and corrected the copying of files in the
    example directory (it seems that the author has some files there
    that don't need to be copied, dh_installexamples doesn't help very
    much...).
  * Made the clean target to depend on clean-debian, to avoid
    repetition of code.

rhtvision (1.0.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * I don't remembered to add -lgpm on the upstream makemak.pl file.
  * Now the symlink is forced (-f parameter to ln).

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Sun, 28 Feb 1999 23:37:46 -0300

rhtvision (1.0.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed some .ex files that never will be necessary.
  * Corrected upstream makemak.pl script to make a shared library that
    has dependencies, also added -pipe switch to gcc (little faster).

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Sun, 28 Feb 1999 22:35:57 -0300

rhtvision (1.0.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Lots of bugfixes and now it works.
  * First version showed to the upstream authors.

 -- Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>  Fri, 19 Feb 1999 02:14:01 -0300

rhtvision (1.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
