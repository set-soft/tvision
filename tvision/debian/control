Description: The RHTVision library - TUI interface for console applications
 This is the shared library for programs using the RHTVision library.
 .
 The RHTVision library gives an intuitive and user friendly TUI (Textual User
 Interface) for programs using this library and running in a text console.
 .
 This library is based on the Turbo Vision library made by Borland Corporation.
 It was interpreted by its upstream authors that the original Turbo Vision
 library was released by Borland (now Inprise) under a Public Domain license,
 but this seems to not be true.
 .
 There's a DOS and Win32 version of this library and on GNU/Linux runs on Alpha
 and i386 processors.
