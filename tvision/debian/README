  This directory contains scripts and helpers used to create DEB packages.
  The name "debian" is because Debian created the DEB format. That's the
same reason why the directory to create the .rpm files is called "redhat"
even when a lot of distros based on RPMs are available.

  These scripts are maintained by Ivan Baldo <ibaldo@adinet.com.uy> so you
should ask Debian specific details to Ivan with Cc to me.

  Using the .deb files instead of just using "make install" you'll get a much
better integration of the library with your system.

  In order to create the .deb files you need to install:

A) Some packages used to create .deb files. I don't have a complete list at
the moment but in my system I have: debianutils, debhelper, debconf-utils,
dpkg-dev and devscripts.

B) Some development packages. They are listed in the "Build-Depends" section
of the debian/control file. If any of them is missing the Debian scripts will
inform it.

C) The fakeroot package if you want to create the .deb files running as a
regular user (recommended).

  To create the .deb files just run:

$ debian/buildpackage

  The resulting DEB files should be located in ../ (../rhtvision*.deb).
  To remove the temporal files created by Debian scripts run:

$ debian/rules clean
