Revision 1.9  1999/01/13 23:26:57  set
* Added "delete.me" files to ensure the empty directories are packaged.
* Silly boy, silly boy, I don't how but some silly options were included in
the DOS libtv.gpr (-funsigned-char and a -W that makes problems with gcc
2.7.x).
* Moved the #include of the standard headers to include these headers before
the C++ headers. If I don't do it default djgpp installations barf about
redefined NULL (no Linux libc5 nor glibc).
* Added instructions to workaround a bug in the gettext distribution for
djgpp.

Revision 1.5  1999/01/09 20:13:10  set
Incorporated nine examples that implements various widgets. They are very
small applications so the user can see how a simple TVision application can
be setup.
.
Revision 1.4  1999/01/09 17:29:09  set

version djgpp files and compress the files in the djgpp fashion. Asked by DJ.

Revision 1.4  1999/01/09 16:14:41  root
Changed linux/compress by a Perl script that updates readme.txt (version),
generates the tarred files with the right version name and creates the .lsm.
(linux/compress)

Revision 1.3  1999/01/09 14:40:24  root
Changed the Linux compress script to be much more efficient. Added a couple
of files to indicate files to include/exclude in the Linux distribution.
Changed the name of the Linux distribution to 'rhtvision' to avoid collisions
with the already existing tvision package by Sergio Sigala.

gkey.cc
Modified to support a command line switch that enables the new keyboard
mapping the old is the default because is the most common (Debian 2.0 and
Red Hat 5.1).

gkeyli.cc
Added TGKey::SetKbdMapping to support the new keyboard mapping found in the
kbd package shipped with Red Hat 5.2. Using
TGKey::SetKbdMapping(KBD_REDHAT52_STYLE) the new mapping is enabled. It
supports F1-F12, Shift+F1-F12 and Ctrl+F1-F12. Not only a special keyboad map
is needed but a special linux terminfo description is needed too.
If the program runs in console that's not needed but you'll get only F1-F10.

Removed the redundant translation of the Linux IOCTL shift flags to BIOS
format.
Moved 90% of the conditional code to the Linux module.

Added Shit+PgUp, Shift+PgDn, Ctrl+Backspace and Ctrl+Space to the list of
patched keys.
