Revision 1.83  1999/07/31 19:47:52  set
* Fixed: A couple of warnings about delete (void *) reported by gcc 2.95 in
the examples.
* Fixed: A call to delete without [] in dirent.h. Patch by Laurynas.
.
Revision 1.82  1999/07/27 22:06:03  root (set)
* Fixed: Some calls to delete instead of delete[] and delete instead of free.
Patches and suggestions by Laurynas Biveinis <lauras@softhome.net>.
* Added: Now TProgram::idle() releases the CPU by default. You can avoid it
with TProgram::doNotReleaseCPU=1;. Suggested by Laurynas.

Revision 1.81  1999/07/26 23:48:33  set
* Added: TListBoxRec is now publically available from the headers.
* Modified: TSortedListBox::searchPos is now protected instead of private so
childs can know something about the incremental selection.
.
Revision 1.80  1999/07/21 01:15:14  set
* Added: A script to create snap-shots as diffs.
.
Revision 1.79  1999/07/17 22:03:37  root (set)
* Fixed: When exiting and the screen is already suspended I avoid cleaning
it because it is supposed to be already cleaned. Not sure is the best, I
tested it in ttyN and ttypN and works ok for the command line options.

Revision 1.78  1999/07/13 23:10:05  set
* Fixed: 18 const name... in the examples. Reported by Matt Mueller
<donut@azstarnet.com>.
* Added: example on how to release the CPU in the idle() member to the demo
example [Linux patch by Matt, I did the djgpp part].
.
Revision 1.77  1999/07/12 23:36:58  root (set)
* Added: An Eterm theme example and instructions to install it.

Revision 1.76  1999/07/07 23:02:04  set
* Added: a new couple of members to TCommandSet, they are used to enable or
disable a range of commands. I usedit in the editor to disable all the editor
commands when the editor loses the focus. I think that's usefull for any
class that have a big number of commands. The editor currently have over than
128 commands.
.
Revision 1.75  1999/07/03 16:55:54  set
* Fixed: Another call to delete instead of delete[] in the TInputLine
destructor. Patch by Laurynas Biveinis <lauras@softhome.net>.
.
Revision 1.74  1999/07/01 02:42:49  root (set)
* Added: Support for the --report-as-keysyms options of Eterm 0.8.10. It
makes the programs work very well under Eterm, example: in my editor now is
posible to select text with shift and use strange keyboard combinations as
Ctrl+Shift+Insert. With it the support for Eterm is just excellent, slow but
very complet. (Note: I added this swithc to Eterm ;-) THANKs goes to mej
that accepted the patch and commited it in the CVS tree).

Revision 1.73  1999/06/30 23:29:42  set
* Fixed: windowSizeChanged is from TDisplay, but was declared as TScreen
member, gcc 2.96 warns about it as an ANSI C++ violation.
.
Revision 1.72  1999/06/27 20:40:47  root (set)
* Added: More information in Linux TScreen module for cases where the
library fails to open the terminal for output. It seems to happend in some
new Linux installations.

Revision 1.71  1999/06/27 20:19:47  set
* Fixed: TFileInfoPane was using an unitialized buffer when the open dialogs
didn't have any match.

Revision 1.70  1999/06/25 01:29:06  root (set)
* Ported: The TChdirDialog class to Linux. It was there but was a dummy. Now
I can navigate the disk with it.
.
Revision 1.69  1999/06/24 22:33:53  set
* Modified: Now the File Dialog uses an horizontal scroll bar and 2 columns
when only SFNs are available and a vertical scroll bar and 1 column when LFNs
are available. Ivan complained about the horizontal bar ;-)
.
Revision 1.68  1999/06/24 01:55:10  set
* Added: The Calculator from the TVDemo to the library. I did a lot of
changes to the class (it was buggy and had portability problems). Now you
can have the calculator in any program use Uses_TCalculator, see the demo
for an example.
.
Revision 1.67  1999/06/23 23:05:34  set
* Added: Select button to the TFileDialog class (option: fdSelectButton
command: cmFileSelect).
* Modified/Fixed: Now the TFileList generates the cmFileDoubleClicked
broadcast as specified in the TVision help (was a bug in 1.03 fixed in 2.0).
.
Revision 1.66  1999/06/23 02:31:30  set
* Changed: The distance between the buttons in the File Dialog, it was 3 and
now is 2 to allow more buttons (my editor adds 2 buttons).
.
Revision 1.65  1999/06/23 01:15:56  set
* Modified: Now the file dialog doesn't show ".." in the root directory (DOS).
* Fixed: Calling the file dialog with fdNoLoadDir (needed to avoid an extra
directory read, sometimes quite slow) was using a null pointer, also fixed
a memory leak (not releasing the current directory in readDirectory) and
changed delete (char *)directory to delete[] directory;
.
Revision 1.64  1999/06/16 01:44:04  root
* Added: Now the Linux keyboard routines disables ^Z because it is dangerous.
Sugested by Luis Pistoia <lu5gpl@arnet.com.ar>.
.
Revision 1.63  1999/06/12 00:16:15  set
* Fixed: Some calls to delete for memory allocated with new[]. Patchs from
Laurinas, some of them overlaps with patches from Andris.
.
Revision 1.62  1999/06/11 23:55:14  set
* Fixed: Some calls to delete operator passing a void *. Now falling back to
char *. Also the new operator in HistRec class was returning 0 and the new
drafts says it should rise an exception instead. These things are reported
by egcs 2.95.x snapshots with two new warnings:
warning: `void *' is not a pointer-to-object type
operator new should throw an exception, not return NULL
The basic patches (I changed them before applying) were sent bt Andris
Pavenis (he ever uses a cutting edge version of the compiler).
.
Revision 1.61  1999/06/11 00:21:52  set
* Included some files I forgot in the list (keyboard extender and pif
example).
.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.6 release.

Revision 1.59  1999/06/05 22:38:19  root (set)
* Applied patches for Debian package v1.0.5-2. (from Ivan).

Revision 1.58  1999/06/05 02:18:59  set
* Modified: The destroy0 macro to be possible your use in cases like:
if (...) destroy0(...); Suggested by Laurynas Biveinis <lauras@softhome.net>.
Patch from Laurynas rejected because is not practical (generates temporals).
.
Revision 1.57  1999/06/05 01:35:19  set
* Fixed: Calls to delete without using []. According to new standards:
Here is text from a relative old draft of the standard:
0 Accredited Standards Committee*              Doc No:X3J16/96-0225
  X3, INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS                  WG21/N1043
...
  5.3.4  New                                                  [expr.new]
...
21The  way the object was allocated determines how it is freed: if it is
  allocated by ::new, then it is freed by ::delete,  and  if  it  is  an
  array, it is freed by delete[] or ::delete[] as appropriate.
...
  5.3.5  Delete                                            [expr.delete]
...
2 ...                      .  In either alternative, if the value of the
  operand of delete is the null pointer the operation has no effect.  In
  the  first  alternative  (delete  object), the value of the operand of
  delete shall be a pointer to a non-array  object  created  by  a  new-
  expression, or a pointer to a sub-object (_intro.object_) representing
  a base class of such an object (_class.derived_).  If not, the  behav-
  ior is undefined.  In the second alternative (delete array), the value
  of the operand of delete shall be the  pointer  value  which  resulted
  from a previous array new-expression.18) If not, the behavior is unde-
  fined.  [Note: this means that the  syntax  of  the  delete-expression
  must  match the type of the object allocated by new, not the syntax of
  the new-expression.  ] [Note: a pointer to a const  type  can  be  the
  operand  of  a delete-expression; it is not necessary to cast away the
  constness (_expr.const.cast_) of the pointer expression before  it  is
  used as the operand of the delete-expression.  ]
  _________________________
  18)  For  non-zero-length arrays, this is the same as a pointer to the
  first element of the array  created  by  that  new-expression.   Zero-
  length arrays do not have a first element.
And the comp.lang.c++ FAQ says:
[16.12] Can I drop the [] when deleteing array of some built-in type
(char, int, etc)?
No!
Patches to add [] in some necesary places and FAQ quotation provided by
Laurynas Biveinis <lauras@softhome.net>.
I also applied the part that says that is not necesary to cast a const
char * to char * when calling delete.
.
Revision 1.56  1999/06/05 00:40:35  set
* Fixed: Some key bindings in TEditor class (Enter and Backspace for example).
* Modified: Now the doEditDialog function provided in tvedit3.cc can be used
for quick applications because I defined a new version:
ushort doEditDialogDefault( int dialog, va_list arg )
So you can set TEditor to your own function, handle only some cases and call
doEditDialogDefault for the rest. I used it for the installer of the editor.
.
Revision 1.55  1999/05/29 00:52:23  root (set)
* Removed some Debian files no longer needed (Ivan).

Revision 1.54  1999/05/28 01:02:39  set
* Added: Windows NT detection (using the OS environment variable) to the
mouse class so now if NT is detected the mouse is polled and not hooked.
Looks like NT's mouse driver emulation fails to call the RMCB and jumps to
nowhere crashing. Now the mouse is functional in NT.
* Added: A workaround for a bug in Windows NT 4.0 when setting the video
modes with int 0x10. Looks like this bug isn't reproductable in all the
machines but happends in the one I used. NT is clobbering the number of tics
since midnight in the BIOS data area, the number that appears is big enough
to generate a divide overflow in the next call to int 0x21 service 0x2C (get
time), as that's an exception in the real mode code the djgpp program is
killed or hangs.
.
Revision 1.53  1999/05/26 00:03:51  set
* Fixed: a leak in TResourceFile constructor. Patch submited by Laurynas
Biveinis <lauras@softhome.net>.

Revision 1.52  1999/05/23 22:58:08  root (set)
* Modified: Now, in Linux, left alt and right alt are different keys. I did
it because that's the only way to paste with gpm.
.
Revision 1.51  1999/05/21 14:10:02  root (set)
* Fixed: When I removed some code in TScreen I made stdout the output of the
library, but then redirecting the stdout from the program and printing sent
undesired escape sequences to the redirected file. For this reason I open the
tty with other file handle. *NHP* (Never Hit Public, it means only I used a
version with this bug).

Revision 1.50  1999/05/20 22:57:25  root (set)
* Fixed: Now Uses_TStrListMaker defines Uses_TStringList. Patch by Laurynas
Biveinis <lauras@softhome.net>.

Revision 1.49  1999/05/20 02:00:02  root (set)
* Changed: Now TScreen shows an error message if you redirect stdout in the
Linux version, that's nicer than the old behavior: SIGSEGVs ;-)
* Modified: Now TScreen includes sys/io.h instead of sys/perm.h for glibc
because looks like sys/perm.h isn't included in Alpha/Linux's glibc.
Sugested by Dim Zegebart <zager@post.comstar.ru>.

Revision 1.48  1999/05/19 23:27:55  set
* Fixed: a bug in TStrListMaker destructor, ugh! looks like nobody used it
;-). Patch by Laurynas Biveinis <lauras@softhome.net>.
.
Revision 1.47  1999/05/16 22:09:14  root (set)
* Added: My DOS TSR to enhance the keyboard to the distribution.
* Added: A .pif example showing how to prevent using the program in a window
and recover some keys like Alt+Space.
* Moved the Linux code from screen.cc to classes/linux/tscreen.cc.
* Added: The ability to use VCSAs even if they are write only.
* Removed the tcget/setattr calls from TScreen because that's done by ncurses.
* Added: A variable to fine tune the video driver called
TurboVision_screenOptions, by now only have meaning under Linux and is used
to tell the TScreen class to not use VCSAs if they are write only (because
then suspend/resume doesn't work properly).
* Modified: Now Alt+key doesn't have any ASCII value associated so if you
press Alt+8 the program won't display 8 if there is no action for Alt+8.
* Added: Documentation in the readmes about the limitations and
particularities of each platform. For example: what doesn't work when using
telnet, how can you paste using gpm, etc.

Revision 1.46  1999/05/15 23:51:09  root (set)
* Good news for xterm funs:
* Fixed: A bug in the startcurses() that made xterm report the wrong codes
for arrow keys and other keys.
* Fixed: A bug and a lack of some stuff during the exit that left the
terminal in a wrong state after exit (including not restoring the screen)
* Added: Support for mouse, isn't as good as gpm because you can't track the
position in real time, but you can resize and move windows anyways.
* Fixed: A bug in the bold reset code, it made a funny effect: when starting
the desktop was with normal fonts, but with the use all were becoming bold.
* Fixed: xterm (and others) doesn't have 16 backgrounds and the color dialog
was trying to show 16.
* Fixed: Now the "User screen" works when the program is in a terminal.
* Added: A temporal workaround to support Eterm when the user have TERM=xterm
(the default in Debian, bug mess Home and End). You need ncurses 4.2 for that.
* Discovered: A thing that was floating in my mind: why mc interfers? simply:
mc runs the childs in ttypN consoles, so you are in a terminal when starting
the editor from mc.
* Modified: Now the ESC delay is 100ms and not 1s.
* Fixed: The DEC character mapping for the scroll bar that is full and the
block used for the color selector. They aren't pretty but at least you can
understand what they mean.
* Added: Handling for SIGWINCH, so now TV applications are resized if the
xterm window is resized.

Revision 1.45  1999/05/13 03:05:03  root (set)
* Added: Support for xterm way of reporting ALT+key (key | 0x80). Now the
startcurses() routine sets the "XtermMode" when the TERM is xterm*. It makes
the editor work much better under xterm, at least in my system.

Revision 1.44  1999/05/12 00:46:41  set
* Fixed: A bug in TSortedListBox when pressing delete it was dereferencing
curString[65536] when the variable is a 256 bytes buffer producing random
crashes. Reported by Christopher Nelson <paradox@gye.satnet.net>.
* Fixed: The logic in backspace used by TSortedListBox was wrong, now seems
to work as expected. I saw it while fixing the other.
.
Revision 1.43  1999/05/10 22:44:32  set
*** NEW *** Thanks to the effort by Dim Zegebart <zager@post.comstar.ru>
(who had patient to test my patches in this platform and send me the errors
reported by gcc and trace backs from the crashes) we managed to get the first
TV programs running in Alpha/Linux.
* Changed: Now the TScreen::screenBuffer member is an (ushort *) instead of
a long. I did it because the code for screen used a lot of casts and have
some errors casting this value to (int) which works in i386 but generated a
SIGSEGV under Alpha ;-).
.
Revision 1.42  1999/05/08 01:49:00  set
* Changed: The initialization for TEventQueue::eventQueue. Looks like egcs
2.91.66 doesn't like partially initialized structures and what is worst likes
to crash if the non-initialized part is an anonymous union (like in TEvent).
In Linux egcs dies, in W95 survives and you get the warning. Ivan reported it
when he tried to make a .deb for Potato using egcs 1.1.2.
.
Revision 1.41  1999/05/06 03:36:24  set
* Added: Now TMenuBar and TStatusLine uses one character around the name of
the item in *both* sides and don't overlap with the next. That's the original
behavior of TV. As it will reduce the number of visible items in the menu
bar for RHIDE (specially in spanish ;-) I added code to automagically compact
the items when they don't have enough space. The compactXXXX member reflects
it and can be forced externally. The value is computed in the constructors
and in the changeBounds. The changes where based in a patch that "Norberto
Alfredo Bensa" <norberto.bensa@abaconet.com.ar> sent me to unconditionally
have the original behavior (which is unacceptable for RHIDE). So I did it in
a way that won't mess RHIDE and is good for users at the same time.
.
Revision 1.40  1999/05/02 14:00:36  set
* Added: The desklogo example to the distribution. I already added it in the
CVS tree (see Revision 1.26) but forgot to add it to the list of distributed
files. Noted by "Norberto Alfredo Bensa" <norberto.bensa@abaconet.com.ar>
.
Revision 1.39  1999/05/02 13:51:09  set
* Avoided the distribution of the Debian files in the DOS release because
these files aren't 8+3 clean and will confuse users.
.
Revision 1.38  1999/04/28 22:57:09  set
* Enclosed all the monochrome code that makes I/O access to the MDA registers
and maps the video memory under Linux with #ifdef __i386__ because looks like
it isn't good idea for Alpha machines ;-).
.
Revision 1.37  1999/04/27 22:34:24  set
* Ported the TParamText class from TV 2.0. The old version seems to be from
1.03 and wasn't portable, in fact it failed to even compile under Alpha
Linux. I added some check to avoid a buffer overflow, something that the
original library never did. I also adapted the getText member for our port
that uses an extra parameter (again to avoid buffer overflows).
.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.5 released. Sources uploaded to DJ's server and my home page. Linux
sources uploaded to my home page. Sources sent to www.linux.org.ar (DanX).

Revision 1.36  1999/04/21 22:46:34  set
* Fixed: The open dialog didn't allow to open files using [];,=+ That's OK
for plain DOS, but when running in Win9x+GUI the LFN API supports it.

Revision 1.35  1999/04/18 22:19:18  root
* Applied changes to the Debian files from Ivan.
.
Revision 1.34  1999/04/13 00:58:11  set
* Modified: The default VESA routines to avoid using DOS allocated memory for
the video mode information. I did it because at least one VESA 2.0 TSR for
S3 chipsets returns more memory than the specified by the spec and corrupts
memory. It could be one of the problems with S3 boards.
.
Revision 1.33  1999/04/10 23:44:10  set
* I was debugging my editor with YAMD to find malloc/free errors, out of
bounds read/writes and leaks. As a result I added propper memory deallocation
to various classes:
* Added: delete mouse to ~TEventQueue.
* Added: delete font to ~TDisplay.
* Modified: TPWriteObjects to destroy your items.
* Added: free to the screen stuff.
* Added: destroy0 to the object.h, that's a macro to call destroy and assign
0 to the freed pointer.
* Added: a member function to collections called setOwnerShip. Passing false
to it the items of the collection aren't removed by shutDown (usefull for
collections of static strings).
.
Revision 1.32  1999/04/04 01:42:36  set
* Fixed: Problems in intl.h with glibc>=2.1. Patch provided by Andris.
* Fixed: TChDirDialog used a fixed maxlength for the directory name instead
of using a limit from the headers. Patch provided by Andris.
* Fixed: TTerminal::prevLine was 100% broken. I rewrote it. Reported by
Andris.
* Fixed?: a label at the end of the post inst files for Debian. Ivan told me
what was needed, not sure if I did it ok.
.
Revision 1.31  1999/04/01 01:28:52  set
* Fixed: Now you can set a VESA video mode using void TDisplay::setCrtMode.
It wasn't possible before because it ever used service 0, now if the mode is
greater than 0x100 I use VBE.
.
Revision 1.30  1999/03/24 23:03:38  root
* Incorporated the 1.0.3-6 Debian package diffs.
* Fixed: Problem with dependencies of the .so library (by Ivan).
.
Revision 1.29  1999/03/23 01:01:38  set
* Added an explanation in the readme.txt about the debian directory that will
generate warnings when uncompressed in plain DOS.
* Modified the compress.pl scripts to only replace vX.X.X in the readme and
not just X.X.X.
.
Revision 1.28  1999/03/23 00:50:35  set
* Changed the name of the library because Sigala's port is older in the Linux
arena and I think the right thing is to differentiate this port calling it
librhtv.a instead of libtv.a. For this reason I changed all the references to
the old name.
* Changed to version 1.0.5 in the scripts.
* Added the Debian stuff to the sources distribution. It will generate some
warnings when using 8+3 filenames in the uncompressor but these files aren't
needed for DOS.
.
Revision 1.27  1999/02/23 22:45:26  root
* Tested the Debian distribution stuff. Works after a couple of small patches
to the rules make script.
.
Revision 1.26  1999/02/23 00:06:25  set
* Added an example of how to change the desktop appearance. Contributed by
Joel <jso@europay.com>.
.
Revision 1.25  1999/02/22 23:04:30  set
* Included the debian directory for the debianization but yet not included in
the distribution package. Debian package by Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>
.
Revision 1.24  1999/02/18 02:41:34  set
* Compiled with djgpp v2.02 and gcc 2.8.1.
.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.4 released. Sources and binaries uploaded to DJ's server and my home
page. Linux sources and binaries uploaded to my home page (including a
dynamic version).

Revision 1.23  1999/02/16 00:33:56  set
* Added more information in readme.txt and fixed some typos.
* Changed the version to 1.0.4 because I'll release it soon.

Revision 1.22  1999/02/10 22:10:29  set
* Fixed a bug in the new terminals code for frames (I forgot to initialize
the array when we use the PC characters).
.
Revision 1.21  1999/02/07 13:56:54  set
* Added a "Try" button to the TColorDialog. It makes a redraw of the screen
and generates a cmUpdateColorsChanged broadcast. The broadcast should be used
by special classes that needs to know that the colors changed, the only one
I know about is my own editor that have a color's cache. This idea was based
on a crazy report by "a.meyer" <hexx3000@schaltzentrale.mvnet.de> ;-).
* Added a Uses_TColorCommands request for the cmUpdateColorsChanged located
in colorsel.h.
.
Revision 1.20  1999/02/02 23:03:19  root (set)
* Adapted the TEditor family to Linux (file I/O stuff and \r\n differences).

Revision 1.19  1999/02/02 01:55:54  set
* Added the TEditor, TFileEditor, TEditorWindow and TMemo classes. I taked
the code from the old RHIDE BETA 4 and adapted it for the new keyboard and
did other small changes.
* Added TEditorApp to the library and a small example to test it.

Revision 1.18  1999/02/02 00:56:55  set
* Minor changes in the readme.txt and porting.txt to give some hints.
.
Revision 1.17  1999/01/31 20:12:44  set
* Added support for S3 (buggy) BIOSes in vesa.cc. It helps to support VESA
text modes when using S3 boards. Reported and tested by Jerzy Witkowski
<jwi@pl.ibm.com>.

Revision 1.16  1999/01/31 19:20:14  root (set)
* Adjusted the examples for Linux (some used dos.h).
* Cleaned the /usr/... dependencies in the example gprs.
* Trying to start a shared repository between DOS and Linux.
.
Revision 1.10  1999/01/22 01:21:19  root (set)
Passed the changes from DOS to Linux.

Revision 1.14  1999/01/22 01:05:37  set
* Fixed the UNIX terminals code to use the ACS_xxxx macros for the frames
instead of falling back to just ASCII. It makes the program look *much*
better when using xterm, gnome-terminal, eterm, etc.

Revision 1.13  1999/01/22 00:34:11  set
* Added clarification in the readme.txt about: license, RHIDE version needed
no-rtti stuff.
* Made the n() macro in tvutil.h visible only when Uses_n is defined.
(Problems reported by Jerzy Witkowski <jwi@pl.ibm.com>).
* Fixed the examples to avoid warnings about NULL redefined.
.
Revision 1.12  1999/01/19 22:54:22  set
* Fixed the gkey.gpr to be usable by anyone ;-). I added an rhide.env file to
give just another example on how to use it with TVision.
.
Revision 1.11  1999/01/19 22:33:36  set
* Released the 1.0.3 version and uploaded to DJ's server.
.
Revision 1.9  1999/01/18 22:55:18  root (set)
* Copied the changes from DOS.
* Added the versions of libraries I use for Linux in the change.log.

Revision 1.10  1999/01/18 22:41:54  set
* Fixed the djgpp makefile switchs.

it's older than the project.

Revision 1.9  1999/01/13 23:26:57  set
* Added "delete.me" files to ensure the empty directories are packaged.
* Silly boy, silly boy, I don't how but some silly options were included in
the DOS libtv.gpr (-funsigned-char and a -W that makes problems with gcc
2.7.x).
* Moved the #include of the standard headers to include these headers before
the C++ headers. If I don't do it default djgpp installations barf about
redefined NULL (no Linux libc5 nor glibc).
* Added instructions to workaround a bug in the gettext distribution for
djgpp.

Revision 1.5  1999/01/09 20:13:10  set
Incorporated nine examples that implements various widgets. They are very
small applications so the user can see how a simple TVision application can
be setup.
.
Revision 1.4  1999/01/09 17:29:09  set
Changed compress.bat for a Perl script that generates the manifest and
version djgpp files and compress the files in the djgpp fashion. Asked by DJ.

Modifications from Linux version.
.
Revision 1.4  1999/01/09 16:14:41  root (set)
Changed linux/compress by a Perl script that updates readme.txt (version),
generates the tarred files with the right version name and creates the .lsm.
(linux/compress)

Revision 1.3  1999/01/09 14:40:24  root (set)
Changed the Linux compress script to be much more efficient. Added a couple
of files to indicate files to include/exclude in the Linux distribution.
Changed the name of the Linux distribution to 'rhtvision' to avoid collisions
with the already existing tvision package by Sergio Sigala.

gkey.cc
Modified to support a command line switch that enables the new keyboard
mapping the old is the default because is the most common (Debian 2.0 and
Red Hat 5.1).

gkeyli.cc
Added TGKey::SetKbdMapping to support the new keyboard mapping found in the
kbd package shipped with Red Hat 5.2. Using
TGKey::SetKbdMapping(KBD_REDHAT52_STYLE) the new mapping is enabled. It
supports F1-F12, Shift+F1-F12 and Ctrl+F1-F12. Not only a special keyboad map
is needed but a special linux terminfo description is needed too.
If the program runs in console that's not needed but you'll get only F1-F10.

Revision 1.2  1998/12/30 01:01:12  set
Removed the redundant translation of the Linux IOCTL shift flags to BIOS
format.
Moved 90% of the conditional code to the Linux module.
Fixed the Linux code to report left and right alt.
Added entries to patch the right alt + function key, not only left alt.
Added Shit+PgUp, Shift+PgDn, Ctrl+Backspace and Ctrl+Space to the list of
patched keys.
