Revision 2.23  2001/12/11 00:59:59  set
* Added: TDisplayDOS is almost finished.
* Added: Started to work on DOS mouse driver.

Revision 2.22  2001/12/11 00:26:45  set
* Added: Some adjusts to compatlayer for Cygwin target. Needed to compile the
editor. Patch from Robert.

Revision 2.21  2001/12/06 01:17:15  set
* Fixed: Some errors in listvi example. It used constant strings for input
lines (read only on UNIX and of limited size a disaster). Also fixed the size
of the columns and input line to be nicer. Reported by Wojciech Warczakowski
(Wowar) <wowar@poczta.onet.pl>.

Revision 2.20  2001/11/29 23:08:41  set
* Modified: Solaris have nl_langinfo so we don't need to use the
replacement. I didn't check if this correction works.

Revision 2.19  2001/11/28 23:41:26  set
* Added: getopt when Solaris is detected.

Revision 2.18  2001/11/25 19:07:33  set
* Added: TEditorApp dependency (TApplication) to the tv.h.

Revision 2.17  2001/11/25 18:46:44  set
* Modified: compatlayer.h should be included just once as tv.h, but this
isn't the case for all the applications and enforces a policy that doesn't
have to be the same used by other projects. For this reason I removed the
protection and any collision will be solved for the particular case instead
of protecting the whole file. After a talk with Andris.

Revision 2.16  2001/11/25 16:12:00  set
* Added: Some support for linux-* terminals. Patch provided by "Dimitar
Jekov" <jimmy@ncp.infonet.bg>

Revision 2.15  2001/11/25 15:44:29  set
* Fixed: Desklogo examples to work with anything different than 80x25 and a
lack of a redraw in tv_logo. Reported by Cesar Rabak <csrabak@uol.com.br>.

Revision 2.14  2001/11/25 14:59:58  set
* Changed: classes/WinNT to winnt, it avoids some problems.
* Compiled all the stuff to verify that I incorporated all the needed code,
it changed makefiles and other stuff.
* Merged Ivan patched for debian package 1.1.3-3, but they are outdated for
this new 2.0.0 branch.
* Added include/tv/drivers.h, it defines prototypes for all the drivers
entry points.
* Added classes/tgkey.cc, it replaces gkey.cc but is the abstract driver
base containing common code for all the platforms.

Revision 2.13  2001/11/25 00:41:41  set
* Added: Definitions for middle mouse button and also buttons 4 and 5.

Revision 2.12  2001/11/25 00:39:38  set
* Changed: call to new API name in demo example (to set window title).

Revision 2.11  2001/11/25 00:34:04  set
* Modified: TView because now the functions to set the shape of the cursor
are compatible with BTV 2.0 and not BTV 1.03. Also a change in an extended
member. The names of extended members changed to keep API coherence and
avoid pointer collisions.

Revision 2.10  2001/11/25 00:31:40  set
* Modified: TProgram because I changed the names of some members in TScreen
(all extensions not found in BTV) and to avoid using the magic "dual"
variable. That's temporally part of TDisplay but just to compile, it must
be solved in another way not yet fully defined.

Revision 2.9  2001/11/25 00:29:02  set
* Modified: TEventQueue::resume to avoid calling magic Linux functions, now
TGKey have a suspend/resume for it.

Revision 2.8  2001/11/25 00:26:56  set
* Modified: TColorDialog to avoid using the old getBlinkState function, now
part of the TScreen class.

Revision 2.7  2001/11/25 00:12:12  set
* Added the headers for the Linux and X11 drivers.
* Changed the screen.h, event.h and gkey.h headers to declare the new class
structure.

Revision 2.6  2001/11/25 00:04:03  set
* Changed classes/tdisplay.cc, classes/tscreen.cc and classes/thwmouse.cc
by the new class structure. This is a complete rework of the classes but
maintaining backward compatibility.

Revision 2.5  2001/11/24 23:56:50  set
* Moved gkey.cc, classes/tdisplay.cc, classes/thwmouse.cc and
classes/tscreen.cc to the DOS driver because they have the DOS code. They
will be changed to follow the new class structure.

Revision 2.4  2001/11/24 23:43:28  set
* Added: A new driver for X11, it is quite functional and complete.

Revision 2.3  2001/11/24 23:40:10  set
* Merged: New code for the Linux terminals. It's currently only one driver
(the mouse is the only exception) and should be split in three, but is
adapted to the new class style.

Revision 2.2  2001/11/24 23:21:19  set
* Changed version to 2.0.0 because big changes are about to be merged.

Revision 2.1  2001/11/24 23:18:11  set
* Added: X library detection to the configuration.

Revision 2.0  2001/11/24 23:12:33  set
