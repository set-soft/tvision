Revision 1.42  1999/05/08 01:49:00  set
* Changed: The initialization for TEventQueue::eventQueue. Looks like egcs
2.91.66 doesn't like partially initialized structures and what is worst likes
to crash if the non-initialized part is an anonymous union (like in TEvent).
In Linux egcs dies, in W95 survives and you get the warning. Ivan reported it
when he tried to make a .deb for Potato using egcs 1.1.2.
.
Revision 1.41  1999/05/06 03:36:24  set
* Added: Now TMenuBar and TStatusLine uses one character around the name of
the item in *both* sides and don't overlap with the next. That's the original
behavior of TV. As it will reduce the number of visible items in the menu
bar for RHIDE (specially in spanish ;-) I added code to automagically compact
the items when they don't have enough space. The compactXXXX member reflects
it and can be forced externally. The value is computed in the constructors
and in the changeBounds. The changes where based in a patch that "Norberto
Alfredo Bensa" <norberto.bensa@abaconet.com.ar> sent me to unconditionally
have the original behavior (which is unacceptable for RHIDE). So I did it in
a way that won't mess RHIDE and is good for users at the same time.
.
Revision 1.40  1999/05/02 14:00:36  set
* Added: The desklogo example to the distribution. I already added it in the
CVS tree (see Revision 1.26) but forgot to add it to the list of distributed
files. Noted by "Norberto Alfredo Bensa" <norberto.bensa@abaconet.com.ar>
.
Revision 1.39  1999/05/02 13:51:09  set
* Avoided the distribution of the Debian files in the DOS release because
these files aren't 8+3 clean and will confuse users.
.
Revision 1.38  1999/04/28 22:57:09  set
* Enclosed all the monochrome code that makes I/O access to the MDA registers
and maps the video memory under Linux with #ifdef __i386__ because looks like
it isn't good idea for Alpha machines ;-).
.
Revision 1.37  1999/04/27 22:34:24  set
* Ported the TParamText class from TV 2.0. The old version seems to be from
1.03 and wasn't portable, in fact it failed to even compile under Alpha
Linux. I added some check to avoid a buffer overflow, something that the
original library never did. I also adapted the getText member for our port
that uses an extra parameter (again to avoid buffer overflows).
.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.5 released. Sources uploaded to DJ's server and my home page. Linux
sources uploaded to my home page. Sources sent to www.linux.org.ar (DanX).

Revision 1.36  1999/04/21 22:46:34  set
* Fixed: The open dialog didn't allow to open files using [];,=+ That's OK
for plain DOS, but when running in Win9x+GUI the LFN API supports it.

Revision 1.35  1999/04/18 22:19:18  root
* Applied changes to the Debian files from Ivan.
.
Revision 1.34  1999/04/13 00:58:11  set
* Modified: The default VESA routines to avoid using DOS allocated memory for
the video mode information. I did it because at least one VESA 2.0 TSR for
S3 chipsets returns more memory than the specified by the spec and corrupts
memory. It could be one of the problems with S3 boards.
.
Revision 1.33  1999/04/10 23:44:10  set
* I was debugging my editor with YAMD to find malloc/free errors, out of
bounds read/writes and leaks. As a result I added propper memory deallocation
to various classes:
* Added: delete mouse to ~TEventQueue.
* Added: delete font to ~TDisplay.
* Modified: TPWriteObjects to destroy your items.
* Added: free to the screen stuff.
* Added: destroy0 to the object.h, that's a macro to call destroy and assign
0 to the freed pointer.
* Added: a member function to collections called setOwnerShip. Passing false
to it the items of the collection aren't removed by shutDown (usefull for
collections of static strings).
.
Revision 1.32  1999/04/04 01:42:36  set
* Fixed: Problems in intl.h with glibc>=2.1. Patch provided by Andris.
* Fixed: TChDirDialog used a fixed maxlength for the directory name instead
of using a limit from the headers. Patch provided by Andris.
* Fixed: TTerminal::prevLine was 100% broken. I rewrote it. Reported by
Andris.
* Fixed?: a label at the end of the post inst files for Debian. Ivan told me
what was needed, not sure if I did it ok.
.
Revision 1.31  1999/04/01 01:28:52  set
* Fixed: Now you can set a VESA video mode using void TDisplay::setCrtMode.
It wasn't possible before because it ever used service 0, now if the mode is
greater than 0x100 I use VBE.
.
Revision 1.30  1999/03/24 23:03:38  root
* Incorporated the 1.0.3-6 Debian package diffs.
* Fixed: Problem with dependencies of the .so library (by Ivan).
.
Revision 1.29  1999/03/23 01:01:38  set
* Added an explanation in the readme.txt about the debian directory that will
generate warnings when uncompressed in plain DOS.
* Modified the compress.pl scripts to only replace vX.X.X in the readme and
not just X.X.X.
.
Revision 1.28  1999/03/23 00:50:35  set
* Changed the name of the library because Sigala's port is older in the Linux
arena and I think the right thing is to differentiate this port calling it
librhtv.a instead of libtv.a. For this reason I changed all the references to
the old name.
* Changed to version 1.0.5 in the scripts.
* Added the Debian stuff to the sources distribution. It will generate some
warnings when using 8+3 filenames in the uncompressor but these files aren't
needed for DOS.
.
Revision 1.27  1999/02/23 22:45:26  root
* Tested the Debian distribution stuff. Works after a couple of small patches
to the rules make script.
.
Revision 1.26  1999/02/23 00:06:25  set
* Added an example of how to change the desktop appearance. Contributed by
Joel <jso@europay.com>.
.
Revision 1.25  1999/02/22 23:04:30  set
* Included the debian directory for the debianization but yet not included in
the distribution package. Debian package by Ivan Baldo <lubaldo@adinet.com.uy>
.
Revision 1.24  1999/02/18 02:41:34  set
* Compiled with djgpp v2.02 and gcc 2.8.1.
.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.4 released. Sources and binaries uploaded to DJ's server and my home
page. Linux sources and binaries uploaded to my home page (including a
dynamic version).

Revision 1.23  1999/02/16 00:33:56  set
* Added more information in readme.txt and fixed some typos.
* Changed the version to 1.0.4 because I'll release it soon.

Revision 1.22  1999/02/10 22:10:29  set
* Fixed a bug in the new terminals code for frames (I forgot to initialize
the array when we use the PC characters).
.
Revision 1.21  1999/02/07 13:56:54  set
* Added a "Try" button to the TColorDialog. It makes a redraw of the screen
and generates a cmUpdateColorsChanged broadcast. The broadcast should be used
by special classes that needs to know that the colors changed, the only one
I know about is my own editor that have a color's cache. This idea was based
on a crazy report by "a.meyer" <hexx3000@schaltzentrale.mvnet.de> ;-).
* Added a Uses_TColorCommands request for the cmUpdateColorsChanged located
in colorsel.h.
.
Revision 1.20  1999/02/02 23:03:19  root (set)
* Adapted the TEditor family to Linux (file I/O stuff and \r\n differences).

Revision 1.19  1999/02/02 01:55:54  set
* Added the TEditor, TFileEditor, TEditorWindow and TMemo classes. I taked
the code from the old RHIDE BETA 4 and adapted it for the new keyboard and
did other small changes.
* Added TEditorApp to the library and a small example to test it.

Revision 1.18  1999/02/02 00:56:55  set
* Minor changes in the readme.txt and porting.txt to give some hints.
.
Revision 1.17  1999/01/31 20:12:44  set
* Added support for S3 (buggy) BIOSes in vesa.cc. It helps to support VESA
text modes when using S3 boards. Reported and tested by Jerzy Witkowski
<jwi@pl.ibm.com>.

Revision 1.16  1999/01/31 19:20:14  root (set)
* Adjusted the examples for Linux (some used dos.h).
* Cleaned the /usr/... dependencies in the example gprs.
* Trying to start a shared repository between DOS and Linux.
.
Revision 1.10  1999/01/22 01:21:19  root (set)
Passed the changes from DOS to Linux.

Revision 1.14  1999/01/22 01:05:37  set
* Fixed the UNIX terminals code to use the ACS_xxxx macros for the frames
instead of falling back to just ASCII. It makes the program look *much*
better when using xterm, gnome-terminal, eterm, etc.

Revision 1.13  1999/01/22 00:34:11  set
* Added clarification in the readme.txt about: license, RHIDE version needed
no-rtti stuff.
* Made the n() macro in tvutil.h visible only when Uses_n is defined.
(Problems reported by Jerzy Witkowski <jwi@pl.ibm.com>).
* Fixed the examples to avoid warnings about NULL redefined.
.
Revision 1.12  1999/01/19 22:54:22  set
* Fixed the gkey.gpr to be usable by anyone ;-). I added an rhide.env file to
give just another example on how to use it with TVision.
.
Revision 1.11  1999/01/19 22:33:36  set
* Released the 1.0.3 version and uploaded to DJ's server.
.
Revision 1.9  1999/01/18 22:55:18  root (set)
* Copied the changes from DOS.
* Added the versions of libraries I use for Linux in the change.log.

Revision 1.10  1999/01/18 22:41:54  set
* Fixed the djgpp makefile switchs.
* Added code to the compress perl script to regenerate the makefile if the
it's older than the project.

Revision 1.9  1999/01/13 23:26:57  set
* Added "delete.me" files to ensure the empty directories are packaged.
* Silly boy, silly boy, I don't how but some silly options were included in
the DOS libtv.gpr (-funsigned-char and a -W that makes problems with gcc
2.7.x).
* Moved the #include of the standard headers to include these headers before
the C++ headers. If I don't do it default djgpp installations barf about
redefined NULL (no Linux libc5 nor glibc).
* Added instructions to workaround a bug in the gettext distribution for
djgpp.
.
Revision 1.8  1999/01/13 00:55:43  set
Passed the changes to DOS.
.
Revision 1.7  1999/01/13 00:35:35  root (set)
Added a linuxso directory to create the dynamically linked version of the
library.

Revision 1.7  1999/01/10 16:25:41  set
Fixed the demohelp.h32 name (to be lowercase).

Revision 1.6  1999/01/10 16:04:05  root (set)
Added demo to the Linux distribution.
.
Revision 1.6  1999/01/10 00:47:21  set
Added the Borland's TVision demo. I taked it from the Sigala's port.

Revision 1.5  1999/01/09 20:13:10  set
Incorporated nine examples that implements various widgets. They are very
small applications so the user can see how a simple TVision application can
be setup.
.
Revision 1.4  1999/01/09 17:29:09  set
Changed compress.bat for a Perl script that generates the manifest and
version djgpp files and compress the files in the djgpp fashion. Asked by DJ.
.
Revision 1.3  1999/01/09 17:24:58  set
Modifications from Linux version.
.
Revision 1.4  1999/01/09 16:14:41  root (set)
Changed linux/compress by a Perl script that updates readme.txt (version),
generates the tarred files with the right version name and creates the .lsm.
(linux/compress)

Revision 1.3  1999/01/09 14:40:24  root (set)
Changed the Linux compress script to be much more efficient. Added a couple
of files to indicate files to include/exclude in the Linux distribution.
Changed the name of the Linux distribution to 'rhtvision' to avoid collisions
with the already existing tvision package by Sergio Sigala.

gkey.cc
Modified to support a command line switch that enables the new keyboard
mapping the old is the default because is the most common (Debian 2.0 and
Red Hat 5.1).

gkeyli.cc
Added TGKey::SetKbdMapping to support the new keyboard mapping found in the
kbd package shipped with Red Hat 5.2. Using
TGKey::SetKbdMapping(KBD_REDHAT52_STYLE) the new mapping is enabled. It
supports F1-F12, Shift+F1-F12 and Ctrl+F1-F12. Not only a special keyboad map
is needed but a special linux terminfo description is needed too.
If the program runs in console that's not needed but you'll get only F1-F10.

Revision 1.2  1998/12/30 01:01:12  set
Removed the redundant translation of the Linux IOCTL shift flags to BIOS
format.
Moved 90% of the conditional code to the Linux module.
Fixed the Linux code to report left and right alt.
Added entries to patch the right alt + function key, not only left alt.
Added Shit+PgUp, Shift+PgDn, Ctrl+Backspace and Ctrl+Space to the list of
patched keys.

Revision 1.1  1998/12/22 23:57:46  set
Renamed readme.src to readme.txt.
Added a small change.log, not yet definitive.
