This is an incomplete and inaccurate collection of data about TV streams.
Use it carefuly.

   +------------------------> iopstream <---------------------------+

pstream: Holds a streambuf (protected bp, readable with rdbuf()). These
stream buffers acts like streams but storing data in a memory buffer.
It also keeps the list of registered objects.

opstream: defines all the output operations.

ipstream: defines all the input operations.

iopstream: it just joins the facilities from opstream and ipstream.

fpbase: Holds a filebuf (private and readable with rdbuf()). It just adds to
pstream what's needed to handle file buffers instead of stream buffers, like
open.
A very important detail is that a filebuf is a class derived from streambuf
and hence all streambuf operations are valid. In fact fpbase constructors
sets the bp value to the filebuf using init().

ofpstream: just makes all the output operations available for files.

ifpstream: just makes all the input operations available for files.

fpstream: defines a read/write open.

----------------

Why all of this?

This was designed to provide "persistence". The idea is to create *binary*
files that can hold objects. For this the library keeps a list of registered
objects, each one have a name and function to be called to read the object
from disk.

----------------

What's used by each class from the standard C++ lib:

pstream:
Basically nothing, it have a streambuf pointer but never uses it.
The code uses some some ios flags:
ios::eofbit, ios::failbit and ios::badbit

opstream: (seek, flush, put a char and put various chars)
* CLY_PubSeekOff (seek) attributes: CLY_std(ios::beg), CLY_std(ios::cur) and
all of type CLY_IOSSeekDir.
* CLY_PubSync() (flush)
* sputc (put a char)
* sputn (put chars)
* CLY_std(ios::out)

ipstream: (seek, flush, get a char and get various chars)
* CLY_PubSeekOff (seek) attributes: CLY_std(ios::beg), CLY_std(ios::cur) and
all of type CLY_IOSSeekDir.
* sbumpc (read a char)
* sgetn  (read chars)
* CLY_std(ios::in)
* CLY_std(ios::eofbit)

fpbase: (open, close, open from file h, set buffer and attach)
* Create a filebuf from a file handle.
* open (CLY_OpenModeT modes)
* CLY_PubSetBuf (set the buffer)
* is_open
* attach [optional]
* close
