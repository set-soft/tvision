Driver: DOS

  This is the driver used for the djgpp compiled binaries. The driver works
on DOS systems and any compatible variants. It can be used for any Windows
system including 3.1 and Win32 systems (95, 98, Me, NT, 2000, XP, etc.) and
systems like OS/2 that provides DOS emulation.

1. INTRODUCTION

  This driver is really complex and the only way to make it work properly is
to have a good ammount of testers and maintainers. As the driver is currently
maintained only by me (SET) this driver is in very bad shape.
  The main complexity of this driver is the need to support the restore of
the graphic video modes. This is a complex task because BIOSes have a lot of
bugs in their save/restore state routines. I saw this bugs are becoming more
and more frequent.
  We verified such a bug in Matrox boards, it was fixed, but some people
still have VGA BIOSes with this bug. Then we also saw a similar bug in nVidia
GeForce VGA BIOS, I think it wasn't fixed by nVidia. These are just two
examples of popular boards. As I can't have a collection of video boards and
test the code in each one to see if it works things become quite complex.
  My policy for TV 2.0.0 is to release the driver with the current problems,
but disabling some advanced features. These features won't impact on regular
programs but will most probably be a bad thing for RHIDE. RHIDE is an IDE for
djgpp that uses TV as TUI.
  I think the code should be splitted in at least two drivers. One really
simple driver that doesn't support restoring graphic modes and another more
complex driver. Then RHIDE could request the second driver when a user knows
that graphics are needed and the code works ok for the target system. I don't
plan to do it any time soon unless I get volunteers to help.


2. FEATURES

  The driver supports:

* Video mode configuration. Various modes are known and you can provide your
own mode or use an external program.
* Palette. The speed for it is high.
* Window title set/restore when running on Win32 systems.
* Most keyboard combinations. Some are lost if you use the BIOS strategy.
* Restore command.com screen.
* Fonts. Primary and secondary.


3. CONFIGURATION VARIABLES SPECIFIC FOR THIS DRIVER

  Please read the documentation about the configuration file first.

BIOSKey       Integer  By default the driver reads the keystrokes from the
                       BIOS buffer directly. This is faster and gives more
                       information. On some systems it fails and you'll need
                       to enable it. If you have access to such a system
                       please contact us so we can look for a better
                       solution. Use a value different than 0 to enable it.
PollMouse     Integer  The mouse information can be obtained using a periodic
                       poll or asking the DOS mouse driver to call us when
                       the mouse is moved or a button is pressed. The second
                       option is faster and you can't lose information. The
                       first option is safer. Currently the driver uses a
                       poll strategy by default. You can try disabling this
                       option to get better mouse support. Note that it is
                       always disabled for Windows NT and similar systems
                       (2000, XP, etc.). Use 0 to disable it.
SaveVGAState  Integer  In order to save and restore graphic modes you must
                       save a lot of information. This is achieved using a
                       standard VGA BIOS call. Some buggy BIOSes doesn't
                       implement it or implements it wrongly and returns
                       success. When it happends the result is a mess with
                       the screen, it usually goes black. Currently the
                       default value for it is 0, it means the VGA state
                       isn't saved. If you need to save it try enabling it
                       using a value different than 0.
VGABIOSState  Integer  This is related to the SaveVGAState variable. When
                       enabled we use VGA BIOS for the job. If you disable it
                       the driver will do it manually. It works for the
                       boards with buggy BIOSes, but the board must be 100%
                       VGA compatible at registers level (also the Windows
                       driver if you are using Windows). This uses very low
                       level stuff.
