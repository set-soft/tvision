  This file describes how to compile the package for Linux systems using
GNU tools. So you need a GNU/Linux environment, this is provided by all Linux
distributions I know even when their name doesn't clearly denote they are
GNU/Linux distros.

1. INTRODUCTION

  Most Linux distributions have some package system, is much better if you
create the packages first and then install them. This is because then you can
uninstall the files or install the binaries in another machine that runs the
same distribution.
  Currently the library have scripts to generate packages for distributions
based on .deb and .rpm packages. For other distributions you should follow
the "manual" mechanism.
  For a list of tools and libraries you should have in your system please read
the doc/install/tools.txt file.

2. MANUAL MECHANISM

  Follow the instructions found in the doc/install/unix.txt file.

3. SYSTEMS BASED ON .DEB FILES (DEBIAN GNU/LINUX)

  Follow the instructions found in the debian/README file.

4. SYSTEMS BASED ON .RPM FILES (REDHAT, SUSE, MANDRAKE)

  Follow the instructions found in the redhat/README file.
  Note: As the script to generate the RPM files doesn't check for errors I
recommend trying to follow the "manual" mechanism but skip the installation
procedure. Once you are sure all compiles perfectly for your system then try
this procedure.
