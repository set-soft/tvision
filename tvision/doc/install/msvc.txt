  This file describes how to compile the package for Win32 systems using
Microsoft Visual C compiler. Note that I don't have it and Microsoft doesn't
offer reduced versions for free like Borland does. For this reason this
target ever lags behind. I need volunteer to test this target periodically.

1. INTRODUCTION

  This target is supported because users helped to make it possible. If you
find any problem just do the same the other users did: help to fix them.
  You can also create Win32 versions of this package using BorlandC Builder,
Cygwin or MinGW.
  Versions 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 7.1 compiled the code.


2. HOW TO COMPILE

  I'm trying to unify the compilation process but I need volunteers to help
testing the new MSVC makefiles. For this reason you should use the old
mechanism explained in winnt/readme.txt
  The winnt/Makefile.nmk file contains the information needed to create the
executable just use it with nmake.


3. INSTALLATION

  Currently this target needs manual installation. You can also use the files
without installing just providing the paths to the compiler.
