  This file describes how to compile the package for Win32 systems using
Borland C++ 5.5 free command line tools. Optionally you can use the BorlandC
Builder 6 for it, that's compiler version 5.6. But I can do periodical tests
only with the former. If you want to volunteer to periodically test the code
with other versions please let me know.

1. INTRODUCTION

  The tools can be downloaded from internet without charge. Note: BorlandC
Builder 6 also have a trial I used to fix some issues, but it have a limited
time usage.
  This target is periodically tested for compilation but not much tested for
functionality.
  You can compile the editor to run under Win32 platforms using various
compilers, for this reason I explain the dis/advantages of using BC++ 5.5 for
it.

Advantages:

* Unlike djgpp it generates a Win32 executable, so it integrates better with
Windows NT incarnations (NT, 2000, XP, etc.).
* The resulting binary doesn't need special DLLs.
* BC++ 5.5 compiles really fast.
* You don't need a lot of GNU tools, just the BC++ package distributed by
Borland.
* The environment is very well controlled. If you have BC++ 5.5 free command
line tools it should compile without any problems.

Disadvantages:

* I don't use the resulting binary too much so it is more probable to find
bugs not found in the same version compiled with other compilers.
* BC++ 5.5 is quite inferior when compared with gcc in terms of code
optimization.
* This target can't run the configure script so you can't fine tune the
process.
* The installation isn't automated.



2. HOW TO COMPILE

  Currently I'm in a middle of a transition between an old mechanism and a
new one (may 2003) so I'll give information about both mechanism.

A) The new mechanism:

  Run "make -f Makefile.bcc" this should create the library in the makes
directory. The name is librhtv.lib.

B) The old mechanism:

  Instructions about it are contained in the WinNT directory.
See: winnt/readme.txt



3. INSTALLATION

  Currently this target needs manual installation. You can also use the files
without installing just providing the paths to the compiler.
