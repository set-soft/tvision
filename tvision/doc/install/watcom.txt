1. INTRODUCTION

  This target is supported because users helped to make it possible. If you
find any problem just do the same the other users did: help to fix them.
  You can also create Win32 versions of this package using BorlandC Builder,
Cygwin, MSVC or MinGW.


2. HOW TO COMPILE

  You can use the unified make system:

wmake -f Makefile.wat

  This will generate makes/librhtv.dll


3. INSTALLATION

  Currently this target needs manual installation. You can also use the files
without installing just providing the paths to the compiler.
