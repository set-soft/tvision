  This file describes how to compile the package for DOS (djgpp) systems using
GNU tools. You have to install a quite complete djgpp environment, you can
download it from: http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/

2. COMPILING AND INSTALLING


1. INTRODUCTION

  DJGPP provides a quite POSIX compliant environment for DOS systems. It is
based on GNU tools. In order to compile this package you have to install the
tools listed in doc/install/tools.txt
  A short list of the needed tools is:
  binutils, fileutils, gcc, gpp, gettext, make, perl, shellutils, texinfo and
textutils.

  We compiled the library using DJGPP 2.01, 2.02 and 2.03. Older versions
won't work. The 2.01 version have some bugs that affect this package so I
suggest a newer version.

2. COMPILING

  Once you installed all the needed tools your system will become some kind
of GNU/DOS system. For this reason you can just follow the instructions found
in doc/install/unix.txt The only difference is that you'll have to invoke the
configure.bat file instead of configure script, but as you don't have to type
the extension it looks almost the same as in UNIX:

c:\djgpp\contrib\tvision>configure
