X. SPECIAL NOTES

  To enable this driver you must install allegro (http://alleg.sf.net/). Then
you must configure TV using the --with-alcon option.
  You must also mark the end of the main function using the END_OF_MAIN()
macro, like this:

#define Uses_TProgram
#include <tv.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
...
}
END_OF_MAIN();

  That's needed for Allegro's internal machinery.
  In order to have the END_OF_MAIN declaration you have to request TProgram
class, but that's usually requested by all sources declaring main.
