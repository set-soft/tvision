Driver: Alcon

This is the driver used for various platforms using the Allegro
(a game programming library): http://alleg.sourceforge.net/.
It has the potential of running under the same platforms supported
by Allegro, but at the moment it is being tested only under Linux
(X11 driver precisely).

1. INTRODUCTION

   You will need a version of Allegro installed on your system. The
   driver has the potential to work with a stable Allegro release
   (4.0.x), but on my system I always have the latest unstable
   branch (4.1.x), so you might need this to build the driver. In
   the future I'll make sure it works with 4.0.x, at the moment I
   don't really care as there are not many users (two?).

   Building of the examples/demo seems to work ok. Building of
   Setedit is at the moment not automatic. In order to have
   this driver built by TVision, you need to explicitly pass
   "--with-alcon" to the configure script. And verify that Allegro
   is OK in the output.

   Also, any TVision programs you build with this driver will now
   need the END_OF_MAIN() macro at the end of your main entry point,
   like this:

      #define Uses_TProgram
      #include <tv.h>
      
      int main(int argc, char *argv[])
      {
      ...
      }
      END_OF_MAIN();

   That's needed for Allegro's internal machinery. In order to have
   the END_OF_MAIN declaration you have to request TProgram class,
   but that's usually requested by all sources declaring main.


2. FEATURES

   The driver supports (or rather will some day):

   * Fonts.
   * Palette.
   * Most keyboard combinations, as long as Allegro's driver allows.
   * Mouse.


3. CONFIGURATION VARIABLES SPECIFIC FOR THIS DRIVER

   Please read the documentation about the configuration file first.

   This driver has by default a very low priority. It is in
   development, so you will need to bump the priority integer to
   see it working. If you can't see any graphical difference between
   X11 and Alcon, that means:

   1) You are using rom fonts. You know what you are doing.
   2) Alcon might not have been selected. Press Ctrl+Alt+End to
      see if it exits.

   Example of configuration file ~/.tvrc:

       [TV]
       {
           [Alcon]
           {
               Priority=220
           }
       }

4. FONTS

   If there is no ROM font on your current directory when you
   run your program, you will get the standard ugly 8x8 font of
   Allegro. You can solve this by copying some ROM font to your
   path and modifying the loading font call of AlCon_Init in
   classes/alcon/alcon.cc. This will be more flexible in the future.
