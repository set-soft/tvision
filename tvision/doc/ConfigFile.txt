1. INTRODUCTION

  The Turbo Vision library uses what we call "drivers". They aren't pure
driver as you find in Windows or other programs, but are used for the same.
The main difference between real drivers and what TV uses is that our drivers
aren't separated files, intead they are inside the library.
  These drivers helps to isolate the hardware and system dependent stuff.
With this and with the help of the "compatlayer" library we can support a
wide variety of systems (DOS, FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, Win32, etc.).
  The drivers defines how to access to the screen, keyboard, mouse and other
OS stuff.
  As these drivers are quite different and complex users could need to
configure some details. These details range from very generic to really
driver specific.
  To avoid duplicating code in all applications and simplify the applications
the configuration can be done using a text file.



2. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE USER

  Here I'll explain things that users and programmers needs to know, but not
information that only programmers needs to know.

2.1 NAME OF THE FILE

  The configuration file is called "tvrc". On systems where hidden files have
a name starting with a dot (i.e. Linux) the file can be named ".tvrc".
Applications can use another name, but if the application specific file can't
be loaded the tvrc file is tried.
  The file is searched in the following places:
1) The current directory.
2) The directory indicated by the HOME environment variable.
3) The directory indicated by the HOMEDIR environment variable.
4) The /etc directory.
5) The /dev/env/DJDIR/etc directory. This is DOS specific and used in djgpp
environments. This is translated to %DJDIR%/etc, that's the etc directory
inside the place you installed djgpp.

2.2 STRUCTURE OF THE FILE

  The file is some mix between .ini files and C code. Sections starts with
the name of the section enclosed with brackets (i.e. [TV]). All the contents
of a section is enclosed using braces. Sections can be nested.
  The main section used for TV configuration is called TV. All the
configuration information related to TV must be inside this section.
  Each driver have a short name, please read the documentation about the
drivers to know the names. Here is a the list of currently supported drivers:

DOS    For DOS or compatible systems.
Linux  For GNU/Linux systems.
QNX    For QNXRtP systems.
UNIX   For FreeBSD and other generic UNIX terminals.
Win32  For Win32 (Windows 95 and newer) systems.
WinNT  Also for Win32 systems, just a different approach.
WinGr  For Win32, but uses a graphical approach.
X11    For X11R6 systems, like XFree86.
XTerm  For XTerm and Eterm terminal emulators.

  All the settings for a driver must be inside a section named as the driver.
  Inside the sections you can set the value of the variables that control the
behavior of the driver or TV itself.
  The variables must be followed by an equal sign and the value. Integer
variables can be in decimal, hexadecimal or octal using the C notation.
String variables must be enclosed using double quotes. Avoid using extra
spaces others than indentation spaces.
  Here is a small example:

[TV]
{
 [Driver]
 {
  IntegerVariable=10
  StringVariable="Hello"
 }
}

  Note that applications could have separated sections to define variables
specific for the application.

2.3 VARIABLES TO CONTROL TV

  The following variables controls the behavior of TV and should be defined
inside the TV section.

DontMoveHiddenCursor  Integer Currently TV moves the cursor always, even when
                              hidden. This is a little bit slow but helps
                              Braille terminals. When using the library in
                              slow machines or through slow remote
                              connections you can set this value to anything
                              different than 0 and you'll gain a small
                              speedup.
ShowCursorEver        Integer If the value isn't 0 the text cursor is always
                              visible. This is used for development so you
                              can see where the cursor is located. Braille
                              terminals use the cursor position to read
                              information. If you want to know what a Braille
                              terminal will show you can enable it and
                              look for changes that can help Braille
                              terminals.

2.4 VARIABLES COMMON TO ALL DRIVERS

  The following variables are common to all drivers. It doesn't mean all
drivers will use them, sometimes the driver can't take an action to reflect
the value. An example are the screen size variables, Linux driver can't
change the screen size. Most of these variables can be defined in the TV
section and drivers will use them. So them can be used as defaults for all
drivers. The Priority variable doesn't have any sense in the TV section.

AppCP            Integer Indicates in which code page is encoded the
                         application.
ExtProgVideoMode String  Indicates which external program should be used to
                         set the video mode. Even when that's generic only
                         DOS benefits from it.
FontHeight       Integer Desired font height in pixels.
FontWidth        Integer Desired font width in pixels.
InpCP            Integer Indicates in which code page is encoded the
                         input data from the OS.
Priority         Integer It selects the priority of the driver. Drivers with
                         higher priority are tried first. Usually this value
                         is in the range of 0 to 100. You can use it to force
                         the use of a driver that currently have less
                         priority.
ScrCP            Integer Indicates in which code page is encoded the
                         screen.
ScreenWidth      Integer Desired screen width.
ScreenHeight     Integer Desired screen height.
ScreenPalette    String  This is used to change the color palette. This
                         string should contain the red, green and blue
                         components of the sixteen colors used by TV. Values
                         must be comma separated. So you should provide 48
                         values. If some values are omitted the default VGA
                         BIOS values are used for the rest. The default
                         palette is usually what the VGA BIOS defines, but
                         not always.
VideoMode        Integer Indicates which video mode should be used for the
                         screen. This is useful for DOS, but other drivers can
                         translate the most common DOS modes into a size and
                         try using the size.
AvoidMoire       Integer Indicates the display produces annoying moire effects
                         when drawing "dotted blocks". When enabled the
                         classes tries to avoid using these chars.



3. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE PROGRAMMER

  The configuration file is loaded in the constructor of TProgInit. The
configuration file is controlled by a class called TVMainConfigFile defined
in the configfile.cc source. This is an specialization of the TVConfigFile
class.
  You can define your own sections in the configuration file and look for
configuration information there.
  To use the classes use the Uses_TVConfigFile request.
  You can specify a name for the configuration file, it must be full
qualified (path included). Use the TVMainConfigFile::SetUserConfigFile member
for it. It must be called before the application constructor. If this file
can't be found the library will look for the tvrc/.tvrc file.
  Is also possible to define variables from the application before loading
the configuration file. These variable have more priority than the ones from
the file. Use the TVMainConfigFile::Add members for it. Note this class is
static and you can use it even before TProgInit constructor. Also note you
currently can do it only for TV section.
  The TVMainConfigFile provides a variety of search functions you can use to
look for settings defined in the configuration file.
  TScreen provides some search members that looks for variables in the
section for the current driver, if it fails they search in the TV section.
That's how defaults for all drivers are implemented.
  This functionality was introduced in version 2.0.0 of our port. The Borland
library didn't have it nor any equivalent. The main objetive was to remove
the need for command line switches in all applications and allow the user to
set default values for all TV applications.
